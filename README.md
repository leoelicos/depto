## Introduction

This easy-to-use employee management system allows the user to perform CRUD actions like view, add, update and delete. It would allow a business manager to add and save business data in order to better arrange and document CRUD.

This CLI application uses npm packages `inquirer`, `SQL` and `chalk`.

I made this app in order to learn how to use SQL queries.

I used GitHub Projects and various Pull Requests to create this app: https://github.com/leoelicos/depto/projects/1
